# SQL Data Cleaning Project

## Project Description
This project involves cleansing a layoffs dataset by removing duplicates, standardizing data, handling NULL values, and ensuring data integrity within SQL. The clean dataset is prepared to support accurate analysis and decision-making.

## Key Features
- Removed duplicate records using window functions (ROW_NUMBER) and common table expressions (CTEs).
- Standardized inconsistent text values and handled NULL or missing values across multiple columns.
- Automated creation of staging tables with appropriate data types and constraints.
- Ensured data quality by enforcing schema consistency and removing irrelevant rows or columns.

## Skills Used
- SQL Window Functions, CTEs
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Schema Design & Data Integrity
- Query Optimization

## How to Use
- Execute SQL scripts sequentially to replicate data cleaning steps.
- Use the cleaned staging table as input for downstream analysis or visualization.
